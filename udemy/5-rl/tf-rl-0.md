# Reinforcement Learning with Tensorflow

## What is Reinforcement Learning

* allow auto determine ideal behaviour within a context to maximize its performance
    - e.g high score in a game
* mechanism
    - reward feedback
    - learn behaviour
    - reinforcement signal
* components
    - agent
    - environment
        - not easy shareable
    - action
    - reward
* process (loop)
    agent 
        -> action -> environment -> observes rewards 
        -> back to agent -> update 
        -> redo action --> ...
* common library
    - gym (openai)
